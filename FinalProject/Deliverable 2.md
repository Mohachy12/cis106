Access Log
The access log contains information about requests coming into the web server. This information can include what pages people are viewing, the success status of requests, and how long the server took to respond. Here’s an example of a typical access log entry:

10.185.248.71 - - [09/Jan/2015:19:12:06 +0000] 808840 "GET /inventoryService/inventory/purchaseItem?userId=20253471&itemId=23434300 HTTP/1.1" 500 17 "-" "Apache-HttpClient/4.2.6 (java 1.5)"

Error Log
